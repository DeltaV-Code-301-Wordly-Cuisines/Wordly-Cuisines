                    My name is Sihem. I came to the United States 6 years ago from the country of Algeria. I studied
                    computer
                    science there and graduated with a Master's degree in information systems. When I joined my husband
                    in
                    the United States in 2013, I didn't speak English so I had to start from the bottom of the
                    workforce. I
                    started by working in retail stores then worked as a school bus driver for the Iowa City Community
                    School District for 5 years. I recently heard about DeltaV coding school. I decided to join for the
                    101
                    class to see how it was and ended up signing for all of the courses through 401. It was about time
                    for
                    me to go back to what I am most passionate about; computer science .

                    I first became interested in programming when I was 14 working on game mods and a homebrew online rpg with a friend of mine.
                    That was my first exposure to code and it piqued my interest as a possible career path. I came to DeltaV to hone my skill and 
                    learn new languages that would put me ahead of the curve with proficiency in hirable technologies while giving me the skills and
                    techniques to standout from my peers and competition.  </p>

                    Hello, my name is Marie Antons, itâ€™s nice to meet you. I am a software developer with
                    experience as a Chef and server in the hospitality industry. My prior experience working in the
                    hospitality industry helps me contribute creativity and organization to the projects I am on and has
                    taught me how to be a team player. I love the constant learning and tight knit community involved in
                    software development. I currently have experience with various languages and am always up for
                    learning
                    new languages and skills. I am very excited to bring what I learn into my next career, and
                    contribute to
                    a bigger picture while being a part of a team and making a positive impact.
