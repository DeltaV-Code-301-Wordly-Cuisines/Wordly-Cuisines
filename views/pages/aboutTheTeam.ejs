            <p class="bio">Hello, my name is Marie Antons, itâ€™s nice to meet you. I am a software developer with experience as a Chef and server in the hospitality industry. My prior experience working in the hospitality industry helps me contribute creativity and organization to the projects I am on and has taught me how to be a team player. I love the constant learning  and tight knit community involved in software development. I currently have experience with various languages and am always up for learning new languages and skills. I am very excited to bring what I learn into my next career, and contribute to a bigger picture while being a part of a team and making a positive impact. </p>
